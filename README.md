*Make the executable project the default project.
*There are 2 solutions, one with element-wise search. Another with nested array search in columns as new strings.

*A good algorithm for this is a tree search with DFS or branch and pruning with Dictionaries/Hashset but I find it complex to apply and not so clean so I chose 2 approaches for a matrix that is 64x64 and to be able to show patterns and good practices.
